# Advent of Code 2020

These are my solutions to the [Advent of Code 2020](https://adventofcode.com/2020/) problems.

I took this year to play around with Clojurescript.

## Requirements

You'll need [lumo](https://github.com/anmonteiro/lumo) installed to run the code:

```
npm install -g lumo-cljs
```

## Run

Then, to run the code, simply run:

```
lumo file.cljs
```
